# Brain Organoid Reservoir Computing For Tactile Processing

## Objective 
Brain organoids can act as biological computers, as their organoid neural networks (ONNs)
can be trained similarly to artificial neural networks (ANNs) using electrical stimuli, at a fraction
of the energy usage and cost. When integrated with hardware such as multi-electrode arrays
(MEAs), organoids can perform machine learning computations, with existing work in the field indicating
feasibility of organoids to classify auditory inputs. This project details the evaluation of a
brain organoid from a pre-existing biological neuroplatform for classification of tactile information
from the NeuroTac sensor. Stimulation parameters, sequences of stimulation and other aspects of
computation were investigated, and organoid output in the form of neuronal spiking activity was
recorded using the FinalSpark Neuroplatform and assessed for significant changes above baseline.

## Results
Multiple impulses show a cumulative effect on spiking activity and optimal setting of parameters is
established, no other clear trend in parameters is established. Stimulation impulses show consistent
activity above baseline, although show a large deviation from the mean, likely due to synchronicity
of oscillations in the organoid. Sequences of stimulation show increased spiking activity, with a
somewhat distinct spatiotemporal spiking distribution. The results indicate promising computational
ability of the organoid but many limitations are discovered. This project could be carried
forward to assess the organoidâ€™s classification ability to tactile information.
